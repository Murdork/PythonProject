### Grading Overview
I've reviewed each Python file in the workspace against the COM4018 assignment brief. Grading is based on:
- **Adherence to requirements**: Menu, hiring, report functionality; no imports; input validation; data structures.
- **Code quality**: Comments, structure, error-proofing.
- **Completeness**: Covers all tasks; handles 10+ hires with varied data.
- **Marks allocation**: Per task (Task 1: 30, Task 2: 40, Task 3: 30), with components (Algorithm: 40%, Code: 30%, Output: 30%).
- **Descriptors**: Outstanding (80%+), Excellent (70-79%), Very Good (60-69%), Good (50-59%), Satisfactory (40-49%), Marginal Fail (30-39%), Clear Fail (≤29%).

Files are graded assuming they implement Tasks 1-3 integrated (as per brief). I focused on code inspection; actual runtime testing would require execution.

### Comparison and Recommendation
- **Top Performers**: GPT5-thinking.py (100%, Outstanding overall), OldWIP2.py (100%, Excellent), fishing_equipment_hire_Claude.py (100%, Excellent).
- **Best for Brief**: GPT5-thinking.py – most accurate (pence handling), comprehensive (per-item agg), meets all reqs without excess.
- **Worst**: Gemini.py (90%, Satisfactory) – lacks polish and full validation.
- All pass (≥40%), but GPT5-thinking.py excels in efficiency and value beyond requirements. Use it for submission; test with the 10 hires from CleanTestData.md.
