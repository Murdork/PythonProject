Scenario
You are required to create and test a new software system for a small shop
loaning fishing and camping equipment for hire to customers.
The fishing and camping equipment available for hire and the cost is shown
in figure 2. Customers can rent it from 9am to 6pm each day. The
equipment can be hired from 9am of day 1 but should be returned by 2pm
the next day irrespective of the time of collection on day 1. For each
additional night a 50% discount is applied for each piece of equipment
hired. If the equipment is returned after 2pm, it will still be counted as an
additional night and extra 50% payment for each piece of equipment hired
will need to be paid.
Your new software system should be able to record the details of the
customers and equipment hired as shown in figure 3. It should also provide
a report for the operator when required as shown in figure 4. For this, the
new software system should open with a menu as shown below
